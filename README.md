# PRODUCT-CATALOG-PHP

This is a simple project for managing a product catalog, developed in **native PHP** with a focus on **Hexagonal Architecture**. The project simulates an order and generates a PDF report, without the need for a database.

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project on your local machine and run it.

### Prerequisites

You need the following installed on your system:

  * **PHP**: Version 7.4 or higher.
  * **Composer**: For managing PHP dependencies.
  * **Local web server**: Such as Apache or Nginx (XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP are good options to start).

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/product-catalog-php.git

    ```

2.  **Install Composer dependencies**:

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Web Server Configuration**:

      * Configure your local web server so that the project's root directory is the main folder (where `index.php` is located).
      * No database configuration is required.

4.  **Run the project**:

      * Open your browser and navigate to your local server's URL. For example: `http://localhost/product-catalog-php`.
